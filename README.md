Notes from the book The Linux Command Line by William Shotts

http://linuxcommand.org/tlcl.php

variables=values
- no space!!!!
- shell treats all values as strings

shell functions must contain at least 1 command

exit status
- commands (including scripts and shell functions we write) issue a value to the system when they terminate
- 0 = success
- any other value = failure
